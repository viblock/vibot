# Vibot
The Viblock Discord bot

Vivot is a Discord bot developed for Viblock. Its primary purpose is to allow integration and communication between our Discord server, game servers, website, and social media for the purposes of role synchronisation, global announcements, and more. Additionally, Vibot adds fun features and anything we want but can't find in publically avaliable bots.
